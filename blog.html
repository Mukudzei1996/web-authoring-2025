                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Web development involves building and maintaining websites and web applications, encompassing frontend (UI/UX),
                    backend (server-side logic), and full-stack development. It differs from web design, which focuses on aesthetics
                    rather than functionality. Essential skills include problem-solving, coding proficiency, and an understanding of
                    design principles. The development process includes planning, design, coding, testing, and deployment. While
                    challenging, web development is accessible through education, hands-on practice, and continuous learning, offering
                    rewarding career opportunities.</p>
                <h3>Relevance</h3>
                <p>The article is highly relevant for anyone interested in web development, whether beginners exploring the field or
                    professionals looking to refine their skills. It provides a clear understanding of web development's key components,
                    the necessary skills, and the career opportunities available. As technology continues to evolve, web development
                    remains a crucial industry, shaping digital experiences across businesses, services, and everyday interactions. By
                    outlining the development process and learning pathways, the article serves as a valuable guide for aspiring
                    developers in an ever-growing and in-demand field.</p>

             <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>The article "Can Traditional Web Development Survive AI?" explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming
                the web development landscape. AI automates routine tasks, such as coding and debugging, allowing developers to
                focus more on creative and strategic aspects of design. For instance, AI-powered analytics can analyze user behavior
                to suggest layout changes that enhance user engagement and conversion rates. Despite these advancements, human
                insight remains crucial for understanding nuanced user needs and delivering customized solutions. The integration of
                AI is seen not as a replacement but as an evolution, empowering developers to create more innovative and
                user-centric web experiences.</p>
             <h3>Relevance</h3>
            <p>This article is highly relevant as AI continues to reshape the web development landscape. By automating routine
                coding tasks and optimizing user experiences through data-driven insights, AI is streamlining the development
                process. However, the article highlights that human expertise remains essential for creativity, problem-solving, and
                understanding user needs. Rather than replacing traditional web development, AI serves as a powerful tool that
                enhances efficiency and innovation. This discussion is crucial for developers and businesses adapting to the
                evolving digital space.</p>

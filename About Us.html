          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Mukudzei Chisenwa</strong>, a dedicated student with a strong interest in web development and front-end design. My goal is to become a professional web developer, and the Web Authoring class has played a big role in helping me move closer to that goal.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">How This Class Helped Me</h4>
          <p>Taking this course introduced me to many essential web development skills and technologies. I learned how to create clean, well-structured HTML pages and apply CSS to style them beautifully. I also learned to write JavaScript to make my web pages interactive and dynamic.</p>

          <p>One of the most valuable skills I learned was how to create <strong>responsive web designs</strong>. I now understand how to use media queries and flexible layouts so that websites look great on phones, tablets, and desktops. This is extremely important in today’s mobile-first world.</p>

          <p>Another major takeaway was learning how to use the <strong>Bootstrap framework</strong>. Bootstrap helped me build responsive layouts much faster with its built-in classes for grids, buttons, forms, and components like navbars and cards. I used Bootstrap on several projects to ensure consistency and responsiveness without writing too much custom CSS.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Technologies and Techniques I Used</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML5</strong> – for page structure and semantic markup</li>
            <li><strong>CSS3</strong> – for layout and styling using Flexbox and Grid</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> – for interactive features and event handling</li>
            <li><strong>Bootstrap</strong> – to build responsive and professional-looking interfaces quickly</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong> – using fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> – ensuring my content is usable by all users</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This class gave me the foundation to build real-world websites and the confidence to keep learning and growing as a web developer. I’m excited to continue building my portfolio and eventually work in a role where I can use these skills every day.</p>

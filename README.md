# Student Project Upload Guide  

## Description  

Students will complete weekly projects following the assignment instructions and upload the project files to their GitHub repository using VS Code. This workflow is essential throughout the program, allowing students to test their sites by posting assignments online and viewing them in a browser, just as the world would. Mastering this process is crucial for success in the program.  

## Requirements  

To complete this assignment, follow these steps:  

1. Read **Chapters 1-3** in the textbook  
2. Review the attached articles linked below.  
3. Copy and paste the provided script into an **HTML text editor** (such as VS Code).  
4. Do **not** add any CSS styles (except those explicitly required), images, or JavaScript. This assignment should focus solely on **HTML markup**.  
5. Enhance the page by adding **information about yourself** and your reasons for taking this class. You may use ChatGPT to assist with content creation, but the final content should reflect your personal perspective.  
6. Save the file as **test.html**.  

## Submission  

Once your **test.html** file is complete, follow these steps to upload it to GitHub:  

1. Open **VS Code** and navigate to your project folder.
